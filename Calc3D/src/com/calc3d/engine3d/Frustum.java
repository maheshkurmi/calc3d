/**
  *<p> Represents a rectangular <i> view frustum </i>, the volume of space containing everything
       that is visible in a three-dimensional scene. </p>
   <p> The view frustum is shaped like a pyramid whose apex lies at the <b> camera </b> position. It is bounded by six
       planes, four of which correspond to the edges of the screen and are called the <i> left,
       right, bottom, </i> and <i> top </i> frustum planes. The remaining two planes are called the
       near and far frustum planes, and define the minimum and maximum distances at
       which objects in a scene are visible to the camera. </p>
   <p> The view frustum is aligned to camera space. Camera space, also called eye
       space, is the coordinate system in which the camera lies at the origin, the x axis
       points to the right, and the y axis points upward. Z axis is calculated by using Left Handed system which
       turns out to be vector against the direction of vision (same in OpenGL).  </p>
