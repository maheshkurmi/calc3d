<h3>What is Calc3D?</h3>
<hr>
<p>This program lets you visualize three dimensional mathematical elements , viz Point, vector, line curve and allows to plot and explore 3 Dimensional Graphs of Mathematical Functions.</p>
<p>Source Code is available in Google codes <a href="http://code.google.com/p/calc3d/">http://code.google.com/p/calc3d/</a>. Feel free to modify and play around. If you add some new features that you think should be a part of the distribution, just send me a note.</p>
<p>To contact me, you can send an email to maheshkurmi2010@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Regards,
<br>Mahesh Kurmi.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>If you are using the program, you are running the risk of inadvertantly starting a chain of events which might ultimately cause the destruction of our Universe. If any thing like that (or less serious than that) happens, I will not be held responsible.</p>
<p>Hmm... I tried to put up something similar to the legal jargon accompanying most programs... Seems like I exaggerated slightly.</p>
